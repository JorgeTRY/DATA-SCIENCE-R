# Introduction
#This project represents the culmination of the Harvardx Data Science certificate program, which involves a comprehensive analysis of the Movielens database, a vast repository of user ratings and movie attributes. The database comprises approximately 10 million data points related to 70,000 distinct users and 11,000 movies, divided into training and test sets. The project is divided into two primary components: firstly into an exploratory data analysis phase and secondly it is based on the technique of machine learning model development utilizing the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm and multiple linear regression.

# Methodology 

#The project commences with an in-depth exploratory data analysis where the database is scrutinized and transformed to gain a deeper understanding of the data distribution, patterns, and correlations. Summary statistics and visualizations are employed to elucidate the characteristics of the data. Subsequently, the KNN algorithm is selected and implemented as a machine learning model to develop a movie recommendation system leveraging the Movielens datasets. The algorithm estimates the density function of the predictor variable for each class, enabling non-parametric supervised learning and classification based on proximity.

#In addition, multiple linear regression is developed as a versatile statistical model to evaluate the relationships between a continuous destination and the predictors.

#The ultimate objective is to develop a prediction model that can accurately forecast movie ratings based on user preferences, facilitating genre-based recommendations. The performance of the developed model is evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric, comparing the predictions with the predefined final_holdout_test algorithm

# Conclusion

#The project's execution and application of various codes in both the exploratory and machine learning stages demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the data science methods and models covered throughout the certificate program. The comparison of the training and test datasets and the predefined algorithm facilitates model evaluation, highlighting the importance of selecting the appropriate algorithm, whether it be SVN, multiple regression, or component analysis. Moreover, the movield variable and rating emerge as superior predictors compared to other variables, underscoring their significance in developing an effective movie recommendation system.
